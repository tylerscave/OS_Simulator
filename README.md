# OS Simulator - Paging/Swapping Simulation

Please ensure that you are using Python v3.xx during your development.
The official documentation may be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/)

## src/
This is the home for all source code that will be turned in. Please keep this directory
up to date. If you have code that contributes to the project, implement it here, but first do
test your ideas separately. 

Everything in this directory should ALWAYS compile and run. Do not clutter this folder.
Old/unused code can be copied into the archive/ directory as needed for storage or
backing up but realistically that is what git is for so you should not have to heavily rely
on that.

## tests/
I have created a tests/ directory for attempting to implement *small* snippets for
educational purposes and hopefully to be used eventually in the actual src/ code.

Universally you may run your tests through the unit_tests.py file. Simply add your filename.ext
to the list of tests and run python3 unit_tests.py from the command line. Examples are 
already present if you need a reference.
